This project is about creating a backend using JavaScript, SQL, and Express. 
- I built a RESTful API that can handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Using Express, I set up the server side routing to make sure client requests are handled properly
- SQL helped manage the database for storing and retrieving data

I added testing with Jest to make sure everything works. I wrote some tests to check the API and how it interacts with the database. This project shows that I can build a secure backend whilst doing checks on data validation and error handling.
